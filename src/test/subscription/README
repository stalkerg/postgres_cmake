Regression tests for subscription/logical replication
=====================================================

This directory contains a test suite for subscription/logical replication.

Running the tests
=================

    make check

or

    make installcheck

NOTE: This creates a temporary installation (in the case of "check"),
and some tests may create one or multiple nodes, for the purpose of
the tests.

NOTE: This requires the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.
