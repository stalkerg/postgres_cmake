Tests for LDAP functionality
============================

This directory contains a test suite for LDAP functionality.  This
requires a full OpenLDAP installation, including server and client
tools, and is therefore kept separate and not run by default.  You
might need to adjust some paths in the test file to have it find
OpenLDAP in a place that hadn't been thought of yet.

Also, this test suite creates an LDAP server that listens for TCP/IP
connections on localhost without any real access control, so it is not
safe to run this on a system where there might be untrusted local
users.

Running the tests
=================
